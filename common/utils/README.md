# utils

The utils of the utils :)

A bunch of functions and variables that can be used throughout the projects of this repo.

If they are project-specific, it is prefered to place them in said project's `utils.py` file.  
However if several reuses some code, it might be appropriate to place them in a shared directory like this one.
