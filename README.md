# utils

## How does this repository works ?

Utilities are organized using git's branches system: each utility has its own branch.

# Use these utilities

If you wish to copy an utility, use the command

```
git clone --branch <BRANCH_NAME> https://github.com/Phaide/utils
```

and replace, of course `<BRANCH_NAME>`.
